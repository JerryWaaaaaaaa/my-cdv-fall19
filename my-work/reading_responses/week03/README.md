# Three examples

## First one - Weather Forecast
This is one of the daily cases we encounter in our life. We use the past cases in which temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and wind directions patterns matters, and use them to predict the future weather based on the patterns we've learnt. However, there is always a chance of miscalculation and there are unexpected situations. Thus, even though weather forecast can be used as a reference, I always bring an umbrella with me :D

## Second one - Alipay - Sesame Credit
Alipay uses lots of data it collected from your shopping history, transaction to others, your savings, your relationships, your contract fulfillment history, and many other factors to calculate your capability of returning the loan. Based on its calculation, it gives you different loan quota. However, there were cases that people couldn't return there loan because they were offered way too much in the very beginning.

## Third one - AI-driven Business Decision
For example, PWC has been trying to use AI in its projects. It uses AI to predict future workforce, to decide what skills and roles the future workspace needs. I personally think that, with machine bias, it's hard to guarantee that the AI-based decision making is dependable and will the business function better in the future. It also leads to a question of is AI serving human-being or only capitalists?
