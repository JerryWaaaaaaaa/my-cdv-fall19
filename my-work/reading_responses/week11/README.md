# Three quotes I find interesting

> ...surveillance reviews itself as a wholly retroactive enterprise, incapable of acting in the present and entirely subservient to the established and utterly compromised interests of power...

From real world examples, we can tell that surveillance doesn't not stop violences from happening. The real causes of these violences are not the lack of information. Instead, the causes are the political, moral, and imaginative weaknesses.

This interpretation of surveillance seems to be reasonable. However, the recent violences in Hong Kong make me reconsider the causes. First, as people in mainland China, I'm not sure if we get enough information. Second, for people in the Western world, I'm not sure the source of the information are objective  in the first place. What the media have posted vary drastically from what my friends have described. In this case, what kind of information can be counted as surveillance, and what are 'utterly compromised interests of power'? Thus, from my perspective, the so-called "surveillance" can't be called "surveillance" in the first place, as it's not uncovering the truth, but filtering them.

> Information and violence are utterly and inextricably linked, and the weaponisation of information is accelerated by technologies that purport to assert control over the world. The historical association between military, government, and corporate interests on the one hand, and the development of new technologies on the other, makes this clear.

Personally, I find the term "weaponisation of information" interesting, as it's the total opposite of what Eric Schmidt describes. I think the author is accusing the the information infrastructures' nonfeasance of the "weaponisation of information", as they are supposed to administrate the potential harms going on and stop them at the very beginning while they don't in the actual world. I understand how new technologies are developed for the interest of the military, government, and the corporate, but I don't see how taking the responsibility of monitoring these potential harm would damage their own interest.

> Our thirst for data, like our thirst for oil, is historically imperialist and colonialist, and tightly tied to capitalist networks of exploitation.

Totally agree with this argument. I read an article on how the marketing strategy of Taobao have changed because they are trying to dig up the purchasing power in the third -tier cities (and lower).
