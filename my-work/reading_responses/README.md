# Critical Questions for Big Data

> Raw data is both an oxymoron and a bad idea.

Raw data, according to Wikipedia, means "data that has not been processed for use". Raw data is then collected by researchers, and processed in specific ways, and turns into cooked data. Some people hold the belief that by analyzing data, we can somehow provide truth, and even objectivity. However, objectivity, as a notion, is defined by some subject according to their subjective observation and choices. In other words, the so-called "objectivity" we achieved has been through many kinds of subjectivity when data was processes, the choices of deciding what data to measure, the choice of what topic to choose, and the interpretation we make based on the result. Not to mention that there could be error in the raw data. Thus, just raw data itself is not enough to prove a truth or show objectivity, while by processing data, we already lose the objectivity in the process. We can't simply argue that data could give as insights about truth and objectivity. We have to be really careful with the process so that the outcome is meaningful and comparatively objective.

Twitter data is limited because of several factors.

- Twitter data is not as representative as it is imagined
    - "Twitter User" population can't represent population of all people
    - "Account" and "User" doesn't mean the same thing
    - User's access to Twitter might vary.
- Data provided by Twitter might be filtered and skewed.
- Data source is uncertain.

There is a different between "data is public" and "data is in public". Being in public means that even though the data is accessible to public, it can be simply interpreted by all people. There are process to go through to actually understand what the data really means. While being public means that the data has gone through the whole process of collection, aggregation, and interpretation. Thus, all people can understand the data and understand in their own ways, and lead to varies versions of stories. Thus, even though the data is in public is free to use, we should always be aware of the possible outcomes it might lead to.
