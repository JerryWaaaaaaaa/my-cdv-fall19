# Three datasets that I find interesting

## 1. Returns to Education
Click (here)[https://ourworldindata.org/returns-to-education] to see the detailed description.

This report talks about the skill premium, which means the ratio of the wages of the skilled workers to the unskilled workers.
In the modern context, the "skilled worker" basically means workers with a degree, and the "unskilled worker" means those without a degree. The report talks about how the skill premium changes from 1300s till now, and makes guesses on the reason of these raises and falls. It further introduces the education inequality in the US as well as the relation between skill premium and labor supply.

However, there are much more to explore from this dataset. For example, we can explore if skill premium relates to the (happiness and life balance)[https://ourworldindata.org/happiness-and-life-satisfaction]. We can explore if the skill premium of men and women are equal when other conditions are the same.

The dataset also talks about the ROI (return on investment) of college education, which I think is a good topic. It will be interesting to find the relations between the ROI of education to the education inequality, as well as the current educational cost on children.

## 2. Obesity and Diet Compositions

The dataset shows how obesity is distributed among the world, as well as how it's distributed in male and female. However, it barely talks about the reasons causing the problem. The over intake of calories is definitely the main cause. However, if we take a deeper look into the problem, we can ask ourselves questions such as "Why would people over intake calories?" "What are the food people are taking?" "Is there a discrimination or gap among social classes?" (see dataset about food price (here)[https://ourworldindata.org/food-prices]) These are all really fun to explore.

## 3. Working Hours
Click (here)[https://ourworldindata.org/working-hours] to see the detailed description.

Working hours can relate to many aspects of hour life, and it can also reflect many sociological phenomena. The dataset talks about the change of working hours from the Industrial Revolution. It also indicates that people in richer countries would work less. It's also somehow related to gender inequality in housework.

Even though there are already many correlations found under this topic, there are still some other aspects that I want to explore. Does the decrease of working hours bring more happiness to people? How is working hours related to (Human Development Index)[https://ourworldindata.org/human-development-index]? Is it possible to show the working hours for only male or female, only skilled workers or unskilled workers?
