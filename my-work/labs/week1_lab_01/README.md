# Reflection

This is the in-class exercise for Lab1.

In this assignment, I've learnt how to make a simple bar chart from an array of Javascript objects.

## What I've learnt

- Javascript Object Data Structure (array and object).
- `keys()` returns an Array Iterator object with the keys of an array.
- How to access the value by its key in an object.
`let value = object[key]` or `let value = object.key`
- Reviewed how to create a div / paragraph using `createElement` or `createTextNode`.
